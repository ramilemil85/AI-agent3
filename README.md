# AI Agents – MFA & Property

This project contains:

- MFA-Research Agent (diplomatic writing + research combined)
- Property Agent (for Booking-style property outreach)

You don't need to run this yourself right now. First, just upload it to GitHub so a developer or technical friend can help you.

## Structure

- backend/      → Python backend (brains of the agents)
- openai_gpts/  → JSON files to import into OpenAI GPTs
- frontend/     → (optional) simple web UI placeholder
